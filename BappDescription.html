<p>Provides a GUI to view and edit Unix timestamps in Burp message editors.</p>

<p>Select the timestamp, then right-click and choose "Edit Timestamp" or "View Timestamp". It can handle timestamps in seconds, milliseconds, and microseconds (although the UI reverts this to 0 milli/microseconds).</p>

<p>The "Edit Timestamp" menu is only available on editable objects, and is disabled if the selected value cannot be parsed as a timestamp. If it can be parsed, there is also a tooltip on the menu item showing the date, for a quick conversion.</p>

<p>The "View Timestamp" menu is available on other objects (e.g. Proxy History), if the selected value can be parsed as a timestamp. Again, if it can be parsed, there is a tooltip.</p>
